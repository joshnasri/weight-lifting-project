    <h1>Best Protein Powders for Weight Loss, Muscle Gain, and More</h1>
    <h4>Alongside a top-rated creatine supplement, protein powder is one of the most common staples in an athlete’s pantry because it can help support muscle growth and promote post-workout recovery. But you don’t have to be an athlete to take a protein powder supplement. The best protein powders on the market are designed for anyone looking for on-the-go meal options or who wants to increase their daily protein intake.</h4>
    <h4>Different protein powders are better suited for certain lifestyles or training goals, making it difficult to know which one is right for you. As someone who’s used dozens of protein powders over the years, I know what separates high-quality protein supplements from mediocre ones. To help make your search easier, I compiled a list of some of my favorite protein powders as well as the ones our reviews staff liked the most after several hours of research and testing.</h4>

<h1 style="color: chartreuse;" >Best Overall Protein Powder: Jacked Factory Authentic Iso</h1>

<img src="https://breakingmuscle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Update-Image-Jacked-Factory-Authentic-Iso-Grass-Fed-Whey-Protein-Isolate.webp" style="height: 300px;width: 500px;">
<h4>Jacked Factory Authentic Iso is my top pick for the best overall protein powder because it is affordable, tastes great, and doesn’t have a lot of additives. I love that it provides 25 grams of whey protein isolate per serving, which is higher than many other protein powders I’ve seen. It also mixes well and has a smooth texture, so you don’t have to worry about clumps of powder in your protein shake.</h4>
<h4>Because it’s made from whey protein isolate, it contains just 0.5 grams of fats and one gram of carbohydrates, so it can easily fit into a low-fat or low-carb diet. It can also be a better option for those with lactose intolerance since whey protein isolate has very little lactose and may not cause digestive issues</h4>
<h4>Jacked Factory Authentic Iso isn’t third-party tested, but it is made in a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)-certified and FDA-registered facility. You can still rest assured that it undergoes thorough quality assurance testing to verify the safety and effectiveness of its ingredients.</h4>
<h1 style="color: blue;">Best Unflavored Protein Powder: Naked Nutrition Grass-Fed Whey Protein Powder</h1>
<img src="https://breakingmuscle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Naked-Nutrition-Grass-Fed-Whey-Protein-Powder.webp" style="height: 300px;width: 500px;">
<h4>An unflavored protein powder is good to keep in your pantry because it blends well with everything. It allows you to enjoy the natural tastes of the other ingredients you put in a protein smoothie or boost the protein content of savory sauces and soups. You can easily mix it with a high-quality pre-workout supplement before your training session. You can even add it to baked goods and not worry about a strange aftertaste ruining your treats.</h4>
<h4>While there are many unflavored protein powders on the market, Naked Whey Protein is one of the best. It contains just one ingredient — whey protein concentrate — and boasts 25 grams of protein per serving, whereas many others only have 20 to 23 grams per serving. There are no added sugars, artificial sweeteners or flavors, or food dyes.</h4>
<h1 style="color: crimson;">Best Protein Powder for Women: Ritual Daily Shake Pregnancy & Postpartum</h1>
<img src="https://breakingmuscle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ritual-Daily-Shake-Pregnancy-Postpartum.webp"style="height: 300px;width: 400px;">
<h4>Women don’t necessarily need a different protein powder than men, but there are certain times when our nutritional needs require special consideration. One of those times is during pregnancy or the postpartum period when the body experiences significant hormonal changes, and women have to worry about their health and the health of their baby.</h4>
<h4>Ritual’s Daily Shake Pregnancy & Postpartum protein powder is one of the only protein supplements I’ve found that’s made specifically for women. One serving provides 250 milligrams of choline, which is necessary for breastfeeding women because it helps with infant growth and development. (1)</h4>
<h4>Vanilla is the only flavor available, but it mixes well with other foods and drinks. However, it does have a gritty texture, though this isn’t unusual for plant-based protein powders because plants have a higher fiber content.</h4>
<h1 style="color: orangered;">Best Protein Powder for Weight Loss: Myprotein Impact Whey Protein</h1>
<img src="https://breakingmuscle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Myprotein-Impact-Whey-Protein-Powder.webp"style="height: 300px;width: 500px;">
<h4>Myprotein’s Impact Whey has been a staple in my supplement routine for years. With just 100 calories per scoop, it’s one of the lowest-calorie options on this list, making it ideal for those on a weight loss journey.</h4>
<h4>I’ve tried the Chocolate Brownie, Chocolate Mint, and Vanilla flavors, and they all had a good flavor and didn’t taste chalky. I especially loved mixing the Chocolate Mint powder in coffee to make a higher-protein, lower-sugar version of a peppermint mocha from Starbucks. I also frequently mix the Chocolate Brownie and Vanilla protein powders with oatmeal, peanut butter, and a banana when I don’t feel like cooking a complicated breakfast. They dissolve well and don’t have a gritty texture.</h4>
<h1 style="color: greenyellow;">Best Tasting Protein Powder: Jacked Factory Authentic Iso</h1>
<img src="https://breakingmuscle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Update-Image-Jacked-Factory-Authentic-Iso-Grass-Fed-Whey-Protein-Isolate.webp"style="height: 300px;width: 500px;">
<h4>Even though there aren’t many flavors to choose from with Jacked Factory’s Authentic Iso protein powder, they taste great and don’t leave a chemical or medicinal aftertaste behind. The flavors are pretty neutral, so you can drink the protein powder on its own or blend it with fruit, add it to baked goods, or mix it in a cup of coffee to boost the protein content.</h4>
<h4>That said, because it contains both sucralose and stevia, you may find it too sweet if you normally consume unsweetened protein powders. The sucralose may also cause bloating or gassiness in those who are sensitive to artificial sweeteners. Still, for an affordable, versatile, tasty protein powder, this can be a good option</h4>
